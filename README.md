IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT DATA:

This repository does not include the original data files (they have been replaced with placeholders -- arg_data.xlsx and metadata.xlsx). If you would like access to the exact data files used in this project, please contact the author directly. The repository is structured to allow anyone with the appropriate data to run the scripts and reproduce the analyses. If the data files are not present, the scripts will skip figure generation and only return a "Data files not found" message.

For data access requests, questions about the analyses, or reproducibility inquiries, please contact:
